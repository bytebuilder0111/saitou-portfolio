Title: Python and JavaScript Engineer | Scalable Web Apps + API Integrations
Overview:
I’m a Web and Data Visualization Engineer with a strong background in SaaS development, custom AI solutions, and third-party API integration. Over the past few years, I’ve worked with startups, digital agencies, and established businesses to build applications that are not only fast and reliable but also smarter through the use of automation and AI.
My approach combines modern web development with data-driven insight. I don’t just deliver code, I help create systems that improve workflows, uncover trends, and support better decision-making. Recent projects include designing an interactive Power BI dashboard for a healthcare client, integrating OpenAI models into a customer support platform, and developing a full-stack SaaS product that scaled from prototype to production.
I focus on building long-term, maintainable solutions. That means clean and well-structured code, clear documentation, and performance-oriented design. Clients often work with me not only to launch new products but also to optimize and extend existing systems.
If you’re looking for a developer who can bridge web engineering with data science, and who cares about delivering results that move your business forward, I’d be glad to help.
